                        I bring my family here every Sunday, after church, on God's holy day. I believe it is very humbling
                        to our children and helps them recognize how good they have it at home. I of course don't eat anything, 
                        just a few of those jetfuel-bourbon cocktails and make sure my kids finish every scrap of their beaninis.

                        My birthday is on April Fool's day. Every year I am let down when all of my friends and family make 
                        a joke of my birthday. This year was no different. A friend said he wanted to take me out to eat. 
                        I was skeptical, but it was hard to turn it down. Was this going to be the first year someone actually
                         cared about me? Of course not, stupid me. I wouldn't feed this to a dog.

                        I just have to say I LOVE BIG CHUNGUS. I GET FOOD POISONING NEARLY EVERY TIME I EAT HERE. Nothing really
                        makes me happier. It would be nice to see their prices come down, as it is hard for me to justify spending 
                        this much when I could get a lot more dog food (yum!) for the same price. But, as an aging woman it is nice 
                        how their young male waiter gives me lots of flattery everytime I visit. Oh, and let the chef know if you have
                        dentures, they will gladly puree your meal for you and allow you to beer bong it. I really like to do this 
                        with the dogs and guac and their hot dog martini thingy to make a nice sort of shake if you will.

                        I have the great unfortune of owning a bakery in the same building as Big Chungus. Talk about absolute
                        jerks managing the place. They often leave their untied but full bag of garbage outside up against the door to
                        the alley so that when you open it, the garbage falls everywhere. Not to mention just being close to a 
                        restaraunt that serves this tripe is not good for my bakery.
