            you should never come eat here. seriously. this Restaurant is not for 
            everyone. if you come here, you're like seriously stupid. you may have a preexisting
            condition where it's like you're allergic to hotdogs or something, if you do and have medical
            issues as a result of eating here, we will probably like sue you for slander. my uncle Phillip 
            used to be a lawyer and he pretty much says as long as we have this on our website we can't get in trouble,
            and we would win any lawsuit against us. so don't even try it.  <a href="http://yelp.com">you can however leave us any kind of review
            you would like. we get a big kick out of it.</a>
